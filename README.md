# Machine Learning - Exoplanet Exploration



## assumptions and findings

marchine learning, logistic regression and randon forest were used to analyze the data. it was found that a scale had to be applied to the data, in order to obtain a reliable model.

Given the results, after tuning the parameters, it was concluded that the most accurate model is Randon Forest.
